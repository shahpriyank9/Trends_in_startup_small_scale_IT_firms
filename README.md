This is a short analysis based on the data collected by Stack Overflow during the 2018 Developer survey. The question answered in this analysis are related to startup/small scale IT firms. The questions are basically to find out the current popular trends in those firms.

I have tried to answer the following questions in this study:
1.Percentage of People working in Startup/Small Scale firms out of the total survey received.
2.Average Age
3.Average Salary
4.Languages used
5.Operating system used
6.Version Control Used
7.Percentage of people working as a Hobby


This analysis uses Python 3.6 and external modules like numpy and pandas. It is a IPython Notebook which can be run through anaconda.

I have also written a blog on this analysis which can be found here :

The following folders have:
/code --> contains IPython Notebook with detailed steps on how this analysis was done. (since the data was too large for github make sure you put the data in /input path when you run the IPython code)
/input --> please put the data file here when running the IPython code
/visualizations --> All the screenshots of the visualizations in the analysis


The IPython notebook can also be found at kaggle :
